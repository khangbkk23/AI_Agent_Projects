      "2. **Fly to a Neighboring Country**: After reaching an international airport in the US, you can fly to a neighboring country in Asia that shares a border with Vietnam, such as Cambodia or Thailand. From there, you could take a bus to Vietnam. For example, you can take a bus from Phnom Penh (Cambodia) to Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam).\n",

      "- **Currency and Payments**: Ensure you have access to cash or a credit card that works internationally for both bus fares and potential accommodation.\n",
