I am Khang Bui Tran Duy, a highly motivated third-year Computer Science student at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology with a CPA of 3.6/4.0. My expertise lies in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning, evidenced by my ongoing research at the Optimization AI Lab on Continual Learning strategies.Unlike a typical developer, I possess a strong 'Research-to-Production' mindset. I have hands-on experience building end-to-end pipelines—from data preprocessing and algorithm design (using PyTorch/TensorFlow) to model deployment (using Docker/FastAPI). I am eager to collaborate with experts to tackle challenging problems in Computer Vision and NLP, aiming to build scalable, intelligent systems that drive real-world impact.
